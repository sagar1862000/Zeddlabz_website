            The traditional transportation value chain is colliding and
            converging with new wireless and digital technologies to provide new
            value propositions for customers and society. The introduction of
            connectivity, IOT and NextGen technologies like radar and lidar have
            enabled use cases that players in the market are desperate to
            monetise. This has generated a huge range of vertical opportunities
            for organisations, providing a unique value driver for their
            consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value chain will continue to face similar disruption as players
            strive to differentiate themselves from the competition and capture
            their customer's attention. If you decide to take a wait-and-see
            approach, you could risk missing out on capturing market share and
            enabling innovative business models that will keep you relevant and
            driving business forward.
