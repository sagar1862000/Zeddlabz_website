          Many of the most fundamental elements that shape our day—including
          education, utilities, infrastructure, social care, policing,
          transportation and many other services—are provided by entities (such
          as government agencies and state-owned enterprises) in the public
          sector. Most of us rarely stop to think about them unless something
          goes wrong. But the way that public sector agencies deliver these
          essential services has transformed in recent years. This is due to
          increased digital transformation, public-private partnerships and
          challenges such as: shrinking budgets, rising demands from the
          population, and threats from cybercrime and social disorder.

          What hasn't changed? The need for talented people to serve in the
          public sector. Delivering services to a varied set of stakeholders in
          disruptive times requires a highly skilled set of leaders and a
          talented, dedicated workforce. But the war for skilled labor is
          intense, especially with a talent crunch on the horizon.
