              We use our NetWorksÂ® planning software to model air service
              scenarios, based on algorithms used by airlines to make route
              decisions. We access in-the-moment social media data from Google
              Analytics, Forward Keys, Talkwalker, and many other sources to
              understand what customers are looking for in travel and tourism.
              We also lead virtual or in-person Spark Labs workshops to identify
              problems and design innovative solutions, and provide a suite of
              proprietary tools for risk reduction and climate resilience
              efforts.
